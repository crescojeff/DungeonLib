Tony Stiles, author of C Adventure Tookit said to me
 that it is now freeware. I've saved those wendor and support
files for historical purpose, information in them is outdated.
Files are here as I got them from Tony Stiles, only addition or change is that freeware.txt file you're now
reading and re-packaging them as .zip file.
