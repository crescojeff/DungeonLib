        COMMAND
             strings - print strings in a (binary) file.

        FORMAT
             strings [ - ] [ -a ] [ -o ] [ -_n_u_m_b_e_r ] file ...

        DESCRIPTION
             _S_t_r_i_n_g_s looks for ascii strings in a  binary  file  where  a
             string  is  defined  as  any  sequence of 4 or more printing
             characters ending in a newline or  a  null  character.   The
             number  option  is  used  to  change the limit from 4 to the
             given number.  Normally _s_t_r_i_n_g_s will only look in  the  data
             space  of a binary file, the -a option causes the whole file
             to be searched.  The -o option causes strings to be  printed
             one  per  line  with the octal offset of its position in the
             file preceding it.
