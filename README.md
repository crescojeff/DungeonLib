DungeonLib
==========

C/C++ framework, helper lib, and resource management utility for building cross-platform text adventure (and other genre) games

TODO: Finish Tokenizer.cpp implementation, and factor it out to a separate program, ResourceWriter, which can be run
on the resource files to generate the Resources.h file that the main program will reference.
